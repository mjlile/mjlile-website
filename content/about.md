I am a Software Development Engineer II at Amazon, doing backend work on the ordering system for digital content and subscriptions (e.g. Kindle, Audible, Prime).

I graduated from the University of Michigan with a degree in computer science in December 2020. I briefly lived in Seattle, but moved back to Ann Arbor where I now work remotely.
